Count each key you click with a little cat friend!

## Instructions
### 1. Download
Download the repository and unzip it.
### 2. Delete README.md
(After you have read this)
### 3. Start The .exe File
Double click the .exe file inside.
An application will now pop up.
### 4. Close The App
Close the new pop up and take the EXE file out of the folder to wherever you desire.
### 5. Enjoy!
You now have a cat to watch your slow typing!

## Deletion
Open 'C:\Users\ (user) \appdata\local' and find the KeyCount folder.
Next, delete the folder along with the .exe file.
The cat is very sad to see you leave and will forever cherish the memories of you taking ten hours to find the spacebar.
